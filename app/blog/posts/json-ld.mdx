I was on the Train editing my portfolio wondering how I could optimise SEO, and stumbled across JSON-LD.
Normally I see it used in the context of products so that google can pick up information from websites
to then add it to their 'shopping' tab etc. I found that I can include it here though! My schema has defined
'Jake Mackie' as a person, so google *should* crawl me.. as weird as that sounds lol.

My JSON looks something like this:
```tsx
  const jsonLd: Person = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Person",
    ...Me
  }
```

And unpacks a `.json`` file I made, here's what that looks like:
```json
{
    "name": "Jake Mackie",
    "description": "Jake Mackie is a 19-year-old apprentice fullstack developer for Hiyield based in Cornwall.",
    "birthDate": "2005-08-04"
}
```
